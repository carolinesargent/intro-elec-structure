###August 2023

This directory contains notes and exercises intended to introduce students to electronic structure theory and Psi4. The following topics are covered:
1. UHF vs RHF
2. Post-HF methods
3. Basis sets and extrapolation
4. Energy corrections
5. Optimizations and frequencies
6. Intermolecular interaction energies
7. DFT and dispersion corrections

Exercises for each session are included in directories named corresponding to the meeting number. Reading to be completed *before* the meeting are in `prep/` within each meeting's directory.
