### DFT 

Talking points:
1. Choosing a functional and availability in Psi4
2. Grid points
3. Dispersion correction 

Tutorial:
1. Calculate the interaction energy of a benzene dimer with focal-point CCSD(T).
2. Benchmark two chosen functionals with the same basis set. Record your results. Make sure that 
   the two functionals also allow for a -D dispersion correction, but do not use this correction yet. 
3. Now use a finer grid with both functionals. Set spherical points to 590 and radial points to 99.
4. Add a dispersion correction to both functionals.
